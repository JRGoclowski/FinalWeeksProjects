/*Write a program that does a graphical heap sort and shows the heap, step by step as it does its work. Here is the
flow of your program:
1. Create a binary tree with 31 items (5 levels)
2. Store the binary tree in an array of size 32 (indexed 0 to 31- array index #0 will not be used.)
3. Fill the array up with random numbers from 10 to 99 and do not allow duplicates.
4. Display the binary tree on the screen. Allow the user to press a key to continue.
5. Make the binary tree a heap (root of any subtree is larger than either child – max-heap)
6. As the heap is being created, display the tree each time a change happens.
7. When the heap is complete, announce that to the user and allow the user to press a key to continue.
8. Now that you have a heap, sort the heap so that the smallest number is at the root (array index #1) and the
largest is at the bottom right (array index #31). Array index #0 will not be used. Each time you make a
change to the array (the tree) display the tree on the screen.
9. When you have sorted the tree, announce that to the user. Also display all the numbers in order on the
same line. Allow the user to press a key to continue. */
